Chris (09:05 AM): Financially, their projections are ambitious but not unrealistic. We need to hit $5M ARR by 9/5/2025.  
Morgan (09:06 AM): From a market standpoint, early detection tech has huge potential. But regulatory hurdles could slow them down.  
Alex (09:07 AM): Good point. Let’s assign due diligence—Jamie, you’ll handle tech validation, and Morgan, check regulatory pathways. We’ll reconvene next week.
