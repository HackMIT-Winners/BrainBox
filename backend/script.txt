Sarah (CEO): Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. Today’s focus is on our AI Agent Platform roadmap—specifically customer use cases, technical progress, and next week’s investor demo. Let’s dive in.

David (Head of Product): I’ll kick things off. From the customer discovery sessions, the top requests are:

Workflow automation for marketing teams.

A personal research assistant for enterprise analysts.

Customer support triage.

We’ll need to prioritize which ones make it into the demo.

Priya (CTO): From the tech side, the core agent framework is stable. However, multi-agent coordination still has issues with conflicting instructions. We’re testing a new arbitration layer to resolve that.

Ethan (Lead Engineer): On embeddings, we’ve integrated OpenAI’s latest model. Similarity search is fast, but memory persistence across sessions is still buggy. I can patch this by midweek.

Lisa (Head of Marketing): For the investor demo, I suggest we focus on one high-impact scenario: a “research assistant” agent that can summarize reports and suggest insights. That resonates with enterprise investors.

Sarah (CEO): Agreed. Let’s align tasks:

David, draft the demo script emphasizing the “research assistant” scenario. Deadline: Wednesday.

Priya, oversee the arbitration layer fix. Work with Ethan to ensure persistence issues are resolved. Deadline: Friday.

Lisa, prepare the pitch slides and messaging. Coordinate with design for visuals. Deadline: Thursday.

David (Head of Product): Got it, I’ll prepare both a script and a flow diagram for how the agent interacts with the user.

Priya (CTO): Noted. Ethan, let’s set up a sync tomorrow afternoon to test arbitration fixes.

Ethan (Lead Engineer): Works for me. I’ll also push logs to the shared repo so QA can start validating.

Lisa (Head of Marketing): I’ll send a first draft of slides by Thursday morning so we have time for feedback.

Sarah (CEO): Perfect. One last point: let’s schedule a dry run on Friday at 3 PM. Everyone should be ready with their deliverables.
